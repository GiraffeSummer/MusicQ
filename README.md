"# music" 

Music app for queuing music in one playlist over multiple people remotely

It's made for small scaled use (hoping and planning it'll work for bigger use), for now, but feel free to use it or update it as you like, feedback is also always welcome.

better documentation might come in the future but for now it's not worth it.
feel free to use the scripts though.

It's pretty messy but it works fine

I mainly focused on functionality and not as much on looks.

Feel free to try it out on http://musicq.cripplerick.com


Feedback or suggestions are always welcome
