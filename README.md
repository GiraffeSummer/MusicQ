"# music" 

WIP

Music app for queuing music in one playlist over multiple people remotely, it works together with https://github.com/GiraffeSummer/MusicQ
as the front end.

you probably want to change the value for "playlistID" in "/index.js" it'll be the youtube playlist it'll use if you run out of queue videos to play, it'll pick a completely random video to play next from the first 50 videos in this list.

It's made for private use, but feel free to use it or update it as you like, feedback is also always welcome.

better documentation might come in the future but for now it's not worth it.


It's pretty messy but it works fine
