"# music" 

Music app for queuing music in one playlist over multiple people remotely

you probably want to change the value for "playlistID" in "/index.js" it'll be the youtube playlist it'll use if you run out of queue videos to play, it'll pick a completely random video to play next from the first 50 videos in this list.

It's made for private use, but feel free to use it or update it as you like, feedback is also always welcome.

better documentation might come in the future but for now it's not worth it.
feel free to use the scripts though.

It's pretty messy but it works fine

urls to use: all start with "MusicQ/"

/ (nothing) - for adding music to the queue

/player.html - make sure only 1 device (best option is a pc or laptop) is connected to this, this'll actually play the music and handle the queue.

/q.html - to see the queue without the player messing with it.
